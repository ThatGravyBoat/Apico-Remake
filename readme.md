# Apico Remake

This is a remake of the vanilla Apico game using the modding api.<br>
This will include only the code to the mod as I do not own the art as it uses the direct art used in game for the machines and such.

This should not really be loaded as a mod but should more of be used to look at how you can possibly do some stuff in the game using the modding api.

This mod includes some useful utils.

Formatting:

All objects are prefixed with obj_<br>
All utils are prefixed with util_

This formatting allows it to be nicely sorted in the file structure.
Sadly Apico do not support sub paths in the modding modules so this is what ive done.
